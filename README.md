## Classic Season of Discovery
Guess im in for the fun, stay tuned for updates and donate ;)  

## Usage
Raidmembers can type a special keyword in the raidchat (123, summon, sum or port)  
Their names will be added to the summon list and syned to all warlocks using the addon  
The name can be left clicked to target the raidmember  
CTRL+left click to remove a member from the list (synced - name will be removed from all addon users)  
Finally summon the member with right click and send a message to the raid / whisper (member will be removed from the list - synced)  
Drag the frame by holding SHIFT+left click

## Combat Lockdown
Due to Blizzard restrictions it is not possible to update the summon frame during combat, however after leaving combat it may take up to 10 seconds for the name to be displayed.

Please report any bugs to my GitHub site at https://github.com/isitLoVe/RaidSummon/issues

## Support RaidSummon development
If you want new features or are able to code a nicer interface, (FrameXML) feel free to send a pull request via Github.  
I am not a full time developer. It is either play the game or try to add new features to the addon (guess the priority :D).
